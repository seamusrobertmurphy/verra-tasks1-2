7.  Data abstract:

    This dataset was used to create a digital tool prototype for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. The objective is to illustrate the process outlined in the VCS Methodology, specifically VM0010, with an emphasis on simplicity to avoid burdensome complexity. The chosen subsection for digitalization is "8.1.1 Calculation of carbon stocks in commercial timber volumes. The VM0010 methodology, available at [Verra's website](https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VM0010-Methodology-for-IMF-LtPF-v1.3_0.pdf), forms the basis for this tool. Assumptions include pre-existing inventory data following a defined format and assumed values for constants and parameters. Specifically, assumptions provided in the raw dataset included cover stratum, plot, species, tree, volume, species characteristics (hardwood, BCEF_R, CF, D), and plot area (A_sp).

    The output is expected to be a tool programmed in R, with clear instructions and assumptions documented within the tool, which allows users to input relevant data, and generates GHG estimates based on the chosen methodology.
